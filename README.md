# Kwok Shing Yu - Portfolio

## Project Description
Welcome to our web project! We kickstarted this journey by designing our portfolio in Adobe XD during the UX I class, focusing on user experience. Transitioning into Web Dev II, we brought this vision to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our website features a responsive design, showcasing various projects and interactive elements. If you'd like to explore or contribute, simply clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and open the index.html file in your browser. We appreciate any feedback or contributions to enhance our project. Special thanks to Professor Abhay Sharma for his guidance. Enjoy exploring our web creation!

## Challenges
When I used Bootstrap in my project, I had to learn its classes and grid system, which was a bit tricky. Customizing things to look just how I wanted was challenging because I had to find a balance with Bootstrap's own styles. I had to be careful about the file size, making sure not to include things I didn't need to keep my website loading fast. Making my design stand out while using Bootstrap wasn't easy, and I had to be aware of compatibility issues with different web browsers.

## Lessons Learned
Using Bootstrap in my project taught me some important things. Learning the classes and grid system took time, but it made building things faster. I saw how to balance making things look like I wanted while still using Bootstrap's styles. I had to be careful about file size to keep my website loading quickly. Making my design special in Bootstrap was a creative challenge. Testing on different browsers helped me understand compatibility issues.
